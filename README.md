## Design Brief:
At Code Your Future, people love to energise through movement and dancing. They share music using Spotify playlists.

However, the individual playlists depend on their personal preferences: some people like to listen to 10-minute-long classical epics, while others prefer 4 minute pop tunes. Some might not like tracks with explicit lyrics, especially if they listen with kids around.

## User stories:

*As someone who has received a playlist*, I want to create a new playlist based on the filtered tracks so that I can continue to listen to in the future

*As a user*, I want to be able to login to my account securely
