## Design Brief:

At Code Your Future, people love to energise through movement and dancing. They share music using Spotify playlists.

However, the individual playlists depend on their personal preferences: some people like to listen to 10-minute-long classical epics, while others prefer 4 minute pop tunes. Some might not like tracks with explicit lyrics, especially if they listen with kids around.

## User stories:

### MVP goal:

_As a Spotify Playlist Sieve app user_, I can add the URL of another Spotify user's shared playlist into my app input box to access the tracks in that playlist.

_As someone who has received a playlist_, I want to filter out types of tracks from the playlist so that I can remove tracks that I don't want based on the filters below:

_As a Spotify Playlist Sieve app user_, I would like to be able to filter the songs by their duration

_As a Spotify Playlist Sieve app user_, I would like to be able to filter the songs by their content type (child friendly or explicit)
