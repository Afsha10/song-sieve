## Design Brief:

At Code Your Future, people love to energise through movement and dancing. They share music using Spotify playlists.

However, the individual playlists depend on their personal preferences: some people like to listen to 10-minute-long classical epics, while others prefer 4 minute pop tunes. Some might not like tracks with explicit lyrics, especially if they listen with kids around.

## User stories:

_As someone who has received a playlist_, I want to filter out types of tracks from the playlist so that I can remove tracks that I don't want

_As someone who has received a playlist_, I want to create a new playlist based on the filtered tracks so that I can continue to listen to them in the future

_As a user_, I want to be able to login to my account securely
