## Design Brief:

At Code Your Future, people love to energise through movement and dancing. They share music using Spotify playlists.

However, the individual playlists depend on their personal preferences: some people like to listen to 10-minute-long classical epics, while others prefer 4 minute pop tunes. Some might not like tracks with explicit lyrics, especially if they listen with kids around.

## User stories:

_As a Spotify user_, I want to get my playlist with the tracks from Spotify into my app using the playlist URL provided by Spotify (i.e. bringing data into the app)

_As a Spotify Playlist Sieve app user_, I want to be able to see the saved playlists displayed in the app (i.e be able to see the playlists name, the number of tracks in the playlists, may be playlist image)

_As someone who has received a playlist_, I want to filter out types of tracks from the playlist so that I can remove tracks that I don't want

_As someone who has received a playlist_, I want to create a new playlist based on the filtered tracks so that I can continue to listen to them in the future

_As a user_, I want to be able to login to my account securely
